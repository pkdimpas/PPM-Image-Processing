# PPM Image Data Processing
This program is about manipuling an image in PPM format.
The format is simple and straightforward and if you want to practice bitwise manipulation  this is a good environment.

To give you a glimpse on how a "plain" PPM Format, this is how it looks like.
```
P3 # P3 is a magic number 
# use sharp to comment. similar to // 
4 4 # height and width
15 # Maximum color value
 0  0  0    0  0  0    0  0  0   15  0 15
 0  0  0    0 15  7    0  0  0    0  0  0
 0  0  0    0  0  0    0 15  7    0  0  0
15  0 15    0  0  0    0  0  0    0  0  0
```

This program though accepts only raw PPM format (P6 is the magic number).

## How to use

To use the program. you can start by running ppmx.exe
```
$ ./ppmx

Usage: ppmx [options] (filename.ppm)
Options:
-fv             Flip vertically
-fh             Flip horizontally
-w<width>       Scale to the new width (0 - 9999)
-r<angle>       Rotate CW (0 - 359)
-mono           Convert to bilevel (.pbm)format
-gray           Convert to grayscale (.pgm) format
```

If don't trust my .exe file (you should be!), you can copy my code and compile it on your own.

## Commands
1.   -fv: flip vertically
2.   -fh: flip horizontally
3. -w(n): Scale to n width (-w100 means new width is 100)
4. -r(Î¸): rotate in couter clockwise. (-r30 rotate 30 degrees in CW) 
5. -mono: Convert to Bilevel (.pbm) format
6. -gray: Convert to grayscale (.pgm) format

Commands can be specified in any order but no duplication of commands.

### PS
 This program was written when I was still a fresh graduate (2018). There are a lot of things that needs to be changed like proper naming of variables, ineffecient code, fix potential bugs, etc. I don't have plans to update the source code since it is already a bit unreadable to me ðŸ˜…. This will just be my reference and see how much I improve since I started my career.
